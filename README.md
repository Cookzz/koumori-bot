# Koumori Bot

Specially made for nanoha's fan discord.

## Getting Started

Before getting started, you need to create a constants.json file on the root directory of the project and provide the following keys:

1. Discord Bot token (example - "token":"........")
2. IBM API Key (example - "IBM_API_KEY":".......") //this is optional

## Creating an executable for live use

You need these following tools:

1. [ncc](https://github.com/vercel/ncc) - for "file bundling" (combining files into one .js file based on require('..'))
2. [pkg](https://github.com/vercel/pkg) - to convert js/nodejs files to an executable (.exe)

Run these commands on your CLI on the root project directory:

```
ncc build koumori.js -o dist && pkg dist/index.js
```
